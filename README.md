Tried to replicate LinkedIn (without a GUI and in much simpler manner) using C++ and Object Oriented programming

Used OO Programming and MultiFile method to code a system and try to replicate linkedIn.
Users, Companies, Experiences (by users), and Job Requests (by companies) can be added.
Every user can assign a skill to him/herself and apply for jobs; Users can endorse other users' skills and/or follow them;
User and company profiles can be printed, suggested jobs and suggested users (based on open job requests and user's skills) can be printed,
and user networks (followers) can be also printed.
